# Manufacturing Data (Polynomial Regression)
This report presents an analysis of a manufacturing dataset, which simulates real-world data collected from a manufacturing process. The dataset is designed to explore the relationships between various process parameters and product quality. It contains both feature variables that represent process conditions and a target variable that represents the quality rating of the manufactured items.

The data was trained with a polynomial regression model which predicted 96.8% accuracy.
